# hyprrice
My second rice, and mostly my own configs or modified to hell

EndeavorOS blank as starting point
---
# stuff i used:
Hyprland
Waybar
Wofi (application launcher)
kitty (terminal)
---
Nautilus
btop

# scripts (in ~/.config/hypr/scripts):
random-wallpaper.sh (runs swww, updates pywal16 and reloads waybar)

# Yay-packages:
swww (wallpaper)
pywal16 (generates colors)

# SHell:
Zsh (OhMyZsh with powerlevel10k and random customization on it + fastfetch on startup in ~/.zshrc)

alot of extra things ive forgot. LOL this is more of a point in time than a full system meant to be set up again. wallpapers are taken from several github repos i found on reddit
config files arent neccessarily completely written by me, mostly modified code or written by my best friend ChatGPT (thank you bro)
